->It does HMR or hot reloading as well (Hot Module Replacement)- when we make code changes parcel will automatically updates code in browser
->Parcel uses a file watching algorithm and is written in C++
->Gives us faster builds because of caching
->parcel-cache file is created where it does caching(stores things)
->It will also do image optimization
->when we do a production build parcel will minify all our files
->Bundles the files
->will also compress the files
-->It does consistent hashing
->Code splitting
->Differential bundling : it means support of older version browsers
->diagnostic things
->Gives us better error suggestions - Better error handling
->It also gives us a way to host app on https
